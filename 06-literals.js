? Literals

Fixed values and variables values
we have been working with fixed vales, also known as Literals. They are hard coded. 
A literal is an example of things we have already seen - arrays, objects, strings, etc. 

//JS defines two types of values: 
// 1: Fixed values are called Literals
// 2: Variables values are called Variables.

// Literals include: arrays, numbers, booleans, objects, and strings.

let soup = {
    a: 'chicken noodle',
    b: 'tomato',
    c: 'beef and barley'
};

console.log(soup.b);
console.log(soup.a);

let car = 'honda';
// number

let decimal = 10.2;
//number
